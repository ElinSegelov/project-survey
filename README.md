# Survey form with React

✓ Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.

✓ At least one question should use radio buttons.

✓ At least one question should use a select dropdown.

✓ There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

✓ Your site should follow accessibility guidelines

## The problem

I created a one-page form with four different inputs: text, radio buttons, select and range slider. I have ues React, JSX CSS and HTML.
If I had more time I could have made the survey like a typeform, showing one question after another and also conditionally displaying follow-up questions.
For accessability testing I have used https://wave.webaim.org/, https://validator.w3.org/ and the Chorme developer tool Lighthouse.
