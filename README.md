# Project: Survey 
For week six of the Technigo bootcamp (week two of the React sprint) our assignment was to create a survey form, following accessibility guidelines. The servey should contain different input types and when submitted, a summery of the input data shoud be displayed.

## The problem
I created a one-page form for signing up to fake trials to Hogwarts Community College. The form has four different inputs: text, radio buttons, select and range slider. I have ues React, JSX CSS and HTML. For accessability testing I have used https://wave.webaim.org/, https://validator.w3.org/ and the Chorme developer tool Lighthouse. The site has been tested on macOS with the screen reader Voice Over.

If I had more time I could have made the survey like a typeform, showing one question after another and also conditionally displaying follow-up questions.
